# <%= componentName %> Container

> - Containers will wrap some local logic. While it's UX, it's a lot about product expectations.
> - HTML and CSS are not used on Containers, prefer to declare UI with components and props.

## How to use

```
import <%= componentName %>Container from '@<%= componentType %>/<%= componentPath %>'
```

```
<<%= componentName %> />
```
